# üëã Hi, I'm [Viwe Hlatshaneni]

I have a strong interest in technology and creativity because I am a student of software development.  A significant component of my schooling has been my love of creative endeavors and problem-solving.  I like investigating different approaches and fresh viewpoints.  I've been inspired to think beyond functionality and investigate ways to engage and delight users by my passion in user experience.  I'm eager to close the knowledge gap between theory and practice as I get ready to develop my first real-world application.  In order to make sure my program offers true value and improves the user experience, I want to have a deeper understanding of the issue.  As a student, I've experienced growth and discovery, and I can't wait to keep improving and taking on new challenges.
